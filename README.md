# Challenge 1

## Problem Overview: String Compression

Implement a string compression using python. For example, aaaabbbccddddddee would become
a4b3c2d6e2. If the length of the string is not reduced, return the original string.

## Problem Overview: Network Failure Point

We have a mesh network connected by routers labeled from 1 to 6 in a directed manner. Write an
algorithm that can detect the routers with the highest number of connections so we might know which
routers will cause a network failure if removed. Multiple connections between the same routers should be
treated as separate connections. A tie for the most number of connections is possible.

# Challenge 2

## Problem Overview

Implement a print_transfers function that accepts a transaction_hash and gets the transaction logs using
the Etherscan API endpoint.
